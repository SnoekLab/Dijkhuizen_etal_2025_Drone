All data is available on: https://doi.org/10.24416/UU01-S5FCM9

### *Field_setup.figure.R*
Supplementary Figure 1 <br>
Shows the setup of the field. <br>

### *EVI_supp.R*
Supplementary Figure 3 <br>
This script creates an example of how the thresholding on EVI works. <br>

### *Plot_rep_vs_rep.R*
Supplementary Figure 4 <br>
Shows the homogeneity between the different replicates <br>

### *Figure_unpacked_full_snps_manhats.R*
Supplementary Figure 5 <br>
Shows GWAS with unclumped and unbinned SNPs for 5 traits. For comparison with clumped and binned SNPs. <br>

### *H2Comparison.R*
Supplementary Figure 8 <br>
Compares heritability from our ANOVA approach and the more established lme4 approach. Both approaches produce the exact same results <br>

### *TBD.R*
Supplementary Figure 9 <br>
TBD <br>

### *SuppFigGBrat.R*
Supplementary Figure 10 <br>
Shows the usefullness and distribution of the Green/Blue ratio trait. <br>

### *SuppFigRelRed.R*
Supplementary Figure 11 <br>
Shows the usefullness and distribution of the Relative Red trait. <br>

### *HeritabilityPlots.R*
Supplementary Figure 12,13 <br>
Shows the heritability of all phenotyeps and descriptives. <br>

### *SuppNetworks.R*
Supplementary Figure 14 <br>
Creates the clustering with several alternative thresholds. <br>

### *Supplement_figh_height.R*
Supplementary Figure 16 <br>
This script creates an example of how the thresholding on EVI works. <br>

### *QTL8_105.R*
Supplementary Figure 17 <br>
Script to create Supplementary Figure 17 and zoom in on this QTL of interest. <br>

### *Supp_Clustering_All.R*
Supplementary Figure 18 <br>
Describes the clustering we use when looking at all traits including extended descriptives. Useful when examining Supplementary Figure 9. <br>

### *ExtDescriptivesSummary.R*
Supplementary Figure 19 <br>
This script shows all significant SNPs per extended descriptives. By doing this we can attempt to assess the reliability and usefullness of individual descriptives. <br>
